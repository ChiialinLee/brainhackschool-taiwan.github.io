# Overview
This course focuses on advanced data preprocessing and analytical techniques for human brain neurophysiological data including electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and structural/functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The course will be conducted in conjunction with 4-weeks long [BrainHack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/) (**2023/05/08 - 2023/06/04**). We will use a format that combines **self-paced modules learning** with pre-made tutorial and **project-based practice** with Teaching Assistant (TA) advising. Course students will explore relevant topics in interaction with TAs from various backgrounds in order to conduct a practical project.

Student project topics will be determined jointly with the TAs who will provide advice on what are feasible/meaningful goals. We are highly flexible on project topics as long as they are geared to either let students learn new techniques or to complete a real scientific research analysis of extant data within the course time frame. Students will need to submit a project report in the form of a webpage and a recorded video presentation, which will be the basis of the course grade.

{: .warning }
For academic year 2022-2023, National Central University (NCU) will have final-term exams during 2023/05/29 - 2023/06/17, and National Taiwan University (NTU) have final-term exams during 2023/06/05 - 2023/06/09. For students who have foreseen loadings in the period of 4-weeks BrainHack School, we advise you to complete the online modules and initialize your own project before the 4-weeks Brainhack School. During the period of BrainHack school, you would have more flexible schdule that could focus on weekly goals and intermittent interaction with local and international TAs. We expect students and TAs to engage with each other about modules and projects at least **approximately 3 hrs every other day** in this period.

{: .note }
We will use [Discord](https://discord.com/) as local/international platform to raise questions and share ideas for tutorials and projects. Students also need to signup [Github](https://github.com/) account and create repository for your projects. Find the Discord and Github guide in [Technical help]({% link docs/technical/technical.md %}).

# Requirement
We have no hard restrictions, but backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience and coding are strongly recommended. Alternatively, you must have a strong independent motivational capacity to self-learn and acquire the necessary sufficent background to conduct a simple relevant project.
