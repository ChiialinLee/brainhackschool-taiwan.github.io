For Brainhack school Taiwan, we will have two Discord servers. The Discord server for Taiwan hub is ready for you to join, but the Discord server for international communication is not public until the Brainhack School start. Before the Brainhack School, you could have communication with others in Taiwan hub. And, the channels and rules in Taiwan hub are very similar to international Discord server. When the Brainhack School start and the international discord server open, you would feel easy to migrate to another environment and have great communication with people around the world. 

Here is step by step guide to help you quickly get to know how discord works.
